\section*{5.5 Independent living}
There's also the use of MIoT for the elderly and assisted living patient. Using 'things' to 'watch' patients also involves storing data. Just a thought, but if an elderly or assisted living patient were relying on 'notifications in anomaly situations' an adversary has the potential to physically harm the patient.

\section*{5.6 Pharmaceutical industry}
MIoT solutions can be used in the form of a smart label for drugs to track how many are being administered and their statuses. These drugs could be discarded if the necessary conditions of its effectiveness were altered while being transported. Again, an adversary has the potential to disable alerts on such solutions. Some of these solutions would be aimed at stopping the fraud of drugs, and that gives way for the potential of an adversary to thwart these efforts to ensure the continuation of a fake drug income by creating bogus tests or results. Patients could also be reminded to take their drugs on schedule.
